# **UI/UX Design System Recommendation: "Apex"**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

This document outlines a new design system, "Apex," created to refresh the Fantasy Premier League Manager application. The goal is to move away from the current purple-centric theme to a more energetic, professional, and data-friendly palette that aligns with modern sports analytics trends for 2025\.

The "Apex" system is built on a foundation of **vibrant green**, sophisticated neutrals, and impactful accents. It retains the desired "Glass and Glow" aesthetic but refines it for better data clarity, accessibility, and brand positioning as a premium, performance-oriented tool.

## **2\. Core Design Principles**

* **Data-First Clarity:** The color palette must ensure that data visualizations, tables, and statistics are the heroes of the interface. Colors are used to guide the eye and create meaning, not distract.  
* **Energetic & Professional:** The aesthetic should feel dynamic and exciting, like the sport itself, while maintaining a sense of trustworthiness and analytical precision.  
* **Accessibility as Standard:** All primary color combinations for text and backgrounds must meet WCAG AA contrast standards to ensure usability for everyone.  
* **Modern Aesthetics:** We will leverage gradients and glassmorphism to create a sense of depth and a premium, modern feel, reflecting current design trends in tech and sports media.

## **3\. The "Apex" Color Palette**

This palette is designed to be cohesive, accessible, and dynamic across both light and dark modes.

| Role | Color Name | Light Mode (HEX) | Dark Mode (HEX) | Rationale & Color Psychology |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary** | Apex Green | \#10B981 | \#34D399 | **Growth, Action, Positive Stats.** A vibrant, modern green that evokes the football pitch and financial "green." |
| **Secondary** | Volt Magenta | \#D946EF | \#F0ABFC | **Energy, Highlights, Distinction.** A powerful accent for secondary CTAs, key stats, or differentiating data points. |
| **Background** | Slate Echo | \#F8FAFC | \#0F172A | A clean, near-white for light mode and a deep, focused navy for dark mode provide a perfect canvas for data. |
| **Surface** | Frosted Glass | rgba(241,245,249,0.6) | rgba(30,41,59,0.6) | Semi-transparent surface for cards and modals. When combined with backdrop-blur, it creates the glassmorphism effect. |
| **Text (Primary)** | Inkwell | \#020617 | \#F8FAFC | High-contrast, highly legible text for primary content. |
| **Text (Muted)** | Slate Gray | \#64748B | \#94A3B8 | A softer gray for secondary information, descriptions, and labels, reducing cognitive load. |
| **Border** | Slate Border | rgba(148,163,184,0.3) | rgba(148,163,184,0.2) | Subtle, low-opacity borders to define elements without creating harsh lines. |
| **Success** | Success Green | \#22C55E | \#4ADE80 | A clear, positive green for success messages and positive price changes. |
| **Warning** | Warning Amber | \#F59E0B | \#FBBF24 | An attention-grabbing amber for warnings or neutral-to-important notifications. |
| **Destructive** | Destructive Red | \#EF4444 | \#F87171 | A standard, unambiguous red for errors, negative stats, and destructive actions. |

## **4\. Component Mapping & Styling**

Here is a detailed breakdown of how to apply the "Apex" palette to your UI components.

| UI Component | Element | Color Mapping (Light/Dark) | Justification & Effects |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Global** | Page Background (body) | Slate Echo | Provides a clean, neutral canvas that makes data-centric components pop. |
|  | Headings (h1, h2, etc.) | Inkwell | Maximum readability for titles. Consider using Apex Green for hero headings on landing pages. |
|  | Body Text (p, span) | Inkwell for primary text, Slate Gray for muted/secondary text. | Creates a clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary information. |
| **Buttons** | Primary CTA | **Gradient:** Apex Green to a slightly darker shade (\#059669). Inkwell text. | A vibrant, action-oriented button. Add a subtle "glow" box-shadow on hover using Apex Green. |
|  | Secondary | Frosted Glass background, Slate Border, Inkwell text. | A modern, subtle button that doesn't compete with the primary CTA. On hover, background opacity can increase. |
| **Cards** | Background & Border | Frosted Glass background, Slate Border. | **Glassmorphism:** Apply backdrop-blur-xl and a subtle box-shadow. On hover, the border can transition to Apex Green for a glow effect. |
| **Badges** | Player Form (Good) | Success Green background, Inkwell/White text. | Instantly communicates positive performance. |
|  | Player Form (Poor) | Destructive Red background, White text. | Clearly indicates negative performance. |
|  | Price/Position | Slate Gray background (low opacity), Inkwell text. | Neutral, informational badges that don't create visual noise. |
| **Tables** | Header Row | Slate Echo background. | Keeps the table header clean and integrated with the page background. |
|  | Row Hover | Apex Green with 10% opacity. | Provides clear visual feedback on hover without being distracting, reinforcing the primary brand color. |
| **Tabs** | Inactive Tab | Slate Echo background, Slate Gray text. | Muted appearance to show they are not selected. |
|  | Active Tab | Apex Green background, Inkwell/White text. | Clearly indicates the active tab using the primary color. |
| **Dialogs/Modals** | Overlay & Content | Inkwell with 80% opacity for overlay. Frosted Glass with backdrop-blur for content. | Creates the modern, layered glass effect that makes the dialog feel like it's floating above the page. |
| **Inputs** | Border & Ring | Slate Border for default state. On focus, use Apex Green for the focus ring (ring-2). | Provides clear feedback to the user about which input is active. |
| **Tooltips** | Background & Text | Inkwell background, Slate Echo text. | A high-contrast, inverted look that makes tooltips stand out clearly against any background content. |
| **Progress Bars** | Track & Indicator | Slate Gray (low opacity) for the track. Apex Green for the indicator fill. | The primary color clearly shows progress against a neutral background. |

## **5\. Implementation Guide**
